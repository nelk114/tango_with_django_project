# tango_with_django_project
ReiÃàmplementation of the ‚ÄòRango‚Äô application from the ‚ÄòTango with Django‚Äô book for university coursework purposes

Current status: Chapter 10 Complete üéÜÔ∏é

## Running

This version of Rango was built for use with Python 3.11 and Django 2.2.28,
as well as an unspecified version of Pillow;
testing has been done using specifically Python 3.11.11, Django 2.2.28,
and Pillow 11.1.0 (presumably the latest version as of writing)
as provided via `pip`
(in turn as provided by Anaconda, running atop Xubuntu 22.04.5 *Jammy Jellyfish*),
but actual functionality ought(!) to work across a reasonable variety of setups.

To use,
set up relevant versions of Python and auxiliary packages
(recommended to do so in a virtual environment),
then in the root directory run
`python manage.py makemigrations`
to generate the database migrations,
`python manage.py migrate`
to set up the database,
optionally
`python populate.py`
to populate the DB with some default data
(as provided in the above Book),
and finally
`python manage.py runserver`
to serve the site on `localhost:8000`.

The various tagged versions corresponding to specific chapters
should pass the tests
[offered by the authors of the book](https://github.com/maxwelld90/tango_with_django_2_code/)
provided the `makemigrations` step is done;
the migrations have intentionally not been committed as they are autogenerated.
To run these, copy the relevant test into `rango/`
then run `python manage.py test $NAME_OF_TEST`
(with the actual filename of the test script replacing `$NAME_OF_TEST`).
There is no expectation Íù• intermediate commits pass any tests
(though some likely will in practice).
